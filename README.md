# Chronicles of Delonda

Basically, I'm making a 4 player dungeon crawler in Godot. The code is not usable and the game is not playable yet, but I'll update this readme when it is. If you're just super nosy, there are doc strings in the major files to explain how it's meant to work.

The details of the first version are in the CHANGELOG.md. It can connect, chat, and run around (jankily). Wish me luck on getting movement cleaned up for the next one!
